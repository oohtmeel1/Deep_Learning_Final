# Deep_Learning_Final image classification 

Introduction
Machine Learning algorithms that perform image classification are extremely useful and widely used. From imaging studies like the cancer data set we worked with earlier this semester to identifying fruit types, or identifying objects in satellite photos. It is very far reaching and quite useful.

The problem my project aimed to address was one of binary classification. Is it a dog, or is it not a dog. That is the question. And the algorithm I used to solve this problem was a deep learning algorithm called a convolutional neural network (CNN for short). They are designed to detect and partition data into categories and are especially adept at image classification.

Why is it important? The answer to: Is it a dog or not a dog feels rudimentary. But the actual application of such a simple algorithm saves millions of dollars in manpower a year. There are many problems that fall into just two little categories, is it there or is it not. Take for example a company making syringes of some clear solution.The solution must not contain particles of any kind. The number doesn't matter,it is a simple yes or no. Now image a person having to inspect every single one that passes through manufacturing. Not every 10th, not one out of every batch. But hundreds if not thousands a day. That type of work is exausting for a person and turnover would be high for that position. So the savings when a system is put in to detect if there are particles present would be many fold. From hiring and training costs, to the expensive process of investigation if there is a miss, and the cost to the employees themselves that have to perform the task until burnout, then have to ultimately find another position. And since the question is "Is it there or is it not" binary classification will do.

Summary of the proccess The algorithm was fed thousands of images and given time to learn from them, and then metrics were collected (accuracy, loss).
